This project focuses on identifying patterns that may indicate fraud.

### Data
Historical insurance claims data containing customer, claim,
and transaction-related features.

### Tools Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Looker Studio for visualization

### Approach
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset
- Performed exploratory data analysis
- Identified unusual patterns and anomalies in claims

### Key Insights
- Repeated claims within short time periods showed higher risk
- Certain claim categories appeared more prone to anomalies

### Outcome
The analysis supports prioritization of claims for further review
and improved fraud monitoring.
